# ScrapeHtmlWithPandas

An INCREDIBLE shortcut for web scraping HTML tables!!!
## import pandas as pd
## scraper = pd.read_html("URL Address")
use Pandas read_html method and extract a list of all the table elements found at a given URL (table headers, table data, table rows).

Unfortunately, this method is restricted to table elements only and it can't be used for traditional web scraping perks such as logging in, filling forms or pressing on buttons However, if scraping HTML tables is exactly what you seek - this  will change your life!!!
